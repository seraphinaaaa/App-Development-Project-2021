# App-Development-Project-2021

As apart of the Year 1 curriculum in Nanyang Polytechnic, under the module App Development Project, my team and I built a shoe website.

Our website used concepts of object-oriented programming to construct practical software components that are maintainable and extensible. The project involved us developing, testing, and implementing innovative and interactive applications to solve real life problems using design thinking approach and agile process.
